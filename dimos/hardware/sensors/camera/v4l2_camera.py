"""A UVC camera read straight off V4L2, with no vendor SDK in the loop.

Any UVC camera exposes its colour stream as a plain video node the kernel
already knows how to drive. When the vendor stack in front of that node is the
thing failing -- the R1 Pro's two wrist D405s stall inside the RealSense stack
as soon as both stream depth and colour, while the bare colour nodes run at
sensor rate side by side -- this module hands the frames to the rest of dimos
directly. Colour only; depth stays with the vendor driver.

The device is opened lazily and re-opened on any failure, so a camera that is
unplugged, or still held by the vendor driver, logs and waits instead of taking
the blueprint down with it.
