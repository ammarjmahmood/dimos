"""The SceneReplica tabletop benchmark (arXiv 2306.15620) on sim2: 20 scenes of five YCB
objects, 100 trials in all. Each trial asks the agent to pick one object and set it down in
the drop-off square on the table, with the perception stack (``scan_objects``,
``pick_object``, ``place_at``) available. A trial is graded from the recorded ground truth:
half for lifting the object 5 cm at any point (SceneReplica's grasp success), half for the
object ending at rest inside the drop-off (its pick-and-place success); a trial passes only
when both hold. A failed trial also records which stage lost it, perception, planning or
execution, read from the agent's tool calls.

    dimos evals run dimos.evals.suites.scenereplica --agent dimos.evals.agents.pi --tags scene-01
    python -m dimos.evals.suites.lib.scenereplica_summary ~/.local/state/dimos/evals/run-*

The paper picks the five objects of a scene in two orders; the ``order-<k>`` tag gives the
near-to-far order, by distance from the arm base, since the shipped scenes carry no other.
